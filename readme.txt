== Description ==

This plugin replaces the regular post author meta box on the edit post screen with a custom box.  The new author box will allow you to select your post author by clicking on the user's avatar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why was this plugin created? =

Some people are better at seeing things visually rather than reading through text.  This allows you to choose a post author by recognizing their avatar rather than from a drop-down select.

= How do I use it? =

You pretty much use it the same way you always select a post author.  The only difference is that you click their avatar instead of selecting them by user display name.

= Does it work with custom post types? =

Absolutely.  This plugin will work with any post type that adds support for the `author` feature.  By default, this is the `post` and `page` types.  However, many other custom post types support this feature as well.

= Will this work with many authors? =

If you have many potential post authors, this may not be the best plugin.  I can't give you an exact number, but I'd personally not use the plugin with any more than about 15 authors or so.  The more potential authors, the slower the page is going to load because it has to load each one of their avatar images.

= Why are the authors different with WP 4.4? =

In WordPress version 4.4, a new feature was introduced that allows developers to get the exact user roles (and, thus, the exact users) that have permission to edit a post.  So, if you're seeing a different author selection for certain post types in 4.4, it's because you're actually seeing the correct author possibilities for the first time.
